# The greater economic effects of covid-19:

üìâ Indicator: the stock markets have fallen an average of 20% over the last month ‚Äì affecting the tech-market with a 25% drop ‚Äì indicating a next recession. https://www.google.com/finance#wptab=s:H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPQeMSozC3w8sc9YSmpSWtOXmMU4RJyy8xLzEtO9UnMS8nMSw9ITE_l2cXEG-4f5OMS7-sY5O0aEryIlT0NogoAAE2qJkIAAAA

ü•ä Implications: an economic recession can increase death rates by as much as 8%, where the worst-case scenario of covid-19 would kill ~1% (see last post). https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(19)30409-7/fulltext

üåè Context: a recession has been expected to arrive this year, with national debts ballooning and countries (like Italy!) already fighting off a recession for years. https://www.ft.com/content/c789f080-6203-11ea-a6cd-df28cc3c6a68?segmentId=b385c2ad-87ed-d8ff-aaec-0f8435cd42d9

‚òÄÔ∏è On the bright side: even though covid-19 is affecting supply and demand there are little indicators of a broken market like before the 2008 recession. Tech stocks have been astronomically high and are facing a downturn, but this could be the reality check they needed to avoid a bubble. https://www.ft.com/content/c789f080-6203-11ea-a6cd-df28cc3c6a68?segmentId=b385c2ad-87ed-d8ff-aaec-0f8435cd42d9
